var HodgkinHuxleyDescription = '<p>The Hodgkin-Huxley model is a conductance based mathematical model that describes how action potentials ' + 
'in neurons are initiated and propagated. It is a set of non-linear differential equations that approximates the electrical characteristics ' +
'of excitable cells such as neurons. It is a continuous time model.</p>';
